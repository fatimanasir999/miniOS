# miniOS
1. Overview of the OS Simulator:
This project is a simple Operating System simulator built in C++. It mimics how a real OS works by allowing users to run and manage multiple tasks such as Calculator, Clock, Notepad, File operations, Video/Song players, and Games â€” totaling 13 functionalities. It also includes both User Mode and Kernel Mode to demonstrate different levels of control over system operations.

2. Core Features and Functionalities:
15 Built-in Functions: Calculator, Clock, Video Player, Song Player, Notepad, File Operations, Games, etc.
User Mode: Allows users to run, pause, and stop applications.
Kernel Mode: Lets users monitor running processes, view memory/CPU usage, and delete or manage any functionality.
Process Management: Each task runs in a separate process and can be controlled (start/pause/stop).
Task Scheduling: Tasks are managed using scheduling algorithms like First-Come or Round Robin.

3. System Resource Handling:
Memory Management: Memory is allocated when a task starts and freed when it ends.
CPU Allocation: CPU usage is simulated for each process.
User Configuration: At startup, the user can set available memory and CPU settings.
File Operations: File-based tasks can store and retrieve data from disk.

4. Educational Purpose:
This project is designed to help users understand how real operating systems work behind the scenes, including:
Task creation and scheduling
Process control and resource allocation
Differences between user-level and system-level operations
